			expand their arsenal of skills as they forge a new ring of power in order to dismantle the Dark Lord Sauron's influence. The scope is much larger than before, and in order to survive, Talion and Celebrimbor will have to form their own army of orcs, trolls, and dragons--forcing Talion to fight fire with fire to quell the evils of Mordor and beyond.

Of course, there are spoilers abound, so be wary of the road that lays ahead.

			Shadow of Mordor begins during a relatively calm period of Middle-earth, which is largely uncharted territory in Tolkien-lore. The kingdom of Gondor keeps watch of the mostly arid and craggy lands of Mordor due to constant activity from orcs, and the persistent rumors of Sauron's gradual return to power. Gondorian ranger Talion and his family are stationed at one of the garrisons a part of the Black Gate of Mordor, intended to shield the dangers of Mordor from the rest of the land.

		<H2>Death And Rebirth</H2>
			After a day of training and resting with his family, the garrison is suddenly attacked by orcs and Uruks--a, who serve the Dark Lord Sauron. Led by three Black Captains--The Hammer Of Sauron, The Tower Of Sauron, and The Black Hand of Sauron--the overrun the garrison and take control of the Black Gate. Though he's able to fight off several foes, Talion and his family are held captive and used as sacrifices to summon the wraith of long dead Elvish smith master Celebrimbor to fuse with their Dark Lord. Instead, Celebrimbor merges with Talion's soul, saving him from oblivion.

		<H2>Into Mordor</H2>
			Bonded together by the Black Hand's spell, 
				<blockquote>
				<p>Celebrimbor</p>
				</blockquote>
			Celebrimbor--who has apparently lost much of his memories--forms a plan with Talion to exact revenge against Sauron's army, and retake Mordor. Now living as a hybrid of man and wraith, Talion is imbued with radical new abilities that grant him supernatural speed and power, while also allowing him to defy death itself--reviving upon defeat at the many forge towers from Celebrimbor's past. From there, the pair set off to dismantle the Orc hierarchy in Mordor, either through force or sabotage from within.
