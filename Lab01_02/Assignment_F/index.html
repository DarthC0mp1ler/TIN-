		Dark Souls III ($59.99) is developer 
		<a class="link" href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/">From Software</a>'s return to the Souls series after the eldritch madness that was 
		<a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> ($19.99 at GameStop) . 
		In fact, the newest Souls game incorporates gameplay and design elements from virtually all of the team's recent titles. As a result, the gorgeous and action-packed Dark Souls III feels highly familiar, yet fresh and content-rich at the same time. Like all of From Software's launches, however, this PC game is in need of a few patches to adjust weapon balance. Nonetheless, Dark Souls III is easily one of the best games in the series, and one of the year's most outstanding titles thus far. I played Dark Souls III on a gaming desktop, but the action-RPG is also available on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

			Dark Souls III incorporates story elements from both of its predecessors to tell of the cyclical struggle between fire and darkness. You play as a lone, undead warrior, and venture out to retrieve the souls of the violent and chaotic 
			<a class="link" href="https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Lords_of_Cinder"> Lords of Cinder</a>
			. As is From Software's pedigree, the story is told through bits of flavor text in item descriptions, and through the environment itself. Players who are not invested in the game's lore have plenty of beautiful, macabre fantasy setting to explore. Those who enjoy piecing together each game's history will be pleased to see how Dark Souls III incorporates the lore of past games.
		</p>
		<p>
			You select one of a various preset character classes at the start of the adventure. Each class has unique starting stats, which gives them a slight edge over other classes. Knights have high strength and dexterity, while sorcerers start with higher intelligence, for example. As you level up you can augment whatever stats you choose, so you can compensate for the starting differences relatively quickly. But if you're aiming for a particular weapon build, taking advantage of a class' stat boosts means fewer wasted levels in the long run.
		</p>
		<p>
			Environments are strewn with useable equipment and consumable items. Your trusty 
			<a class="link" href="https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Estus_Flask_(Dark_Souls_III)">Estus </a>
			flask is your go-to healing potion, but defense-boosting pellets, throwing knives, firebombs, panaceas, and the like all litter the stages in the game. New weapon and armor sets can also be found within each area, but these are usually cleverly hidden, or guarded by tougher enemies. Not all equipment is made equal, unfortunately, so a new sword you find may not necessarily be better than the one you're currently using. Early on, for example, I fought a vicious, ragged warrior wielding a samurai sword, which I eventually earned upon his defeat. Despite the warrior's flashy attacks, however, it was inferior in every way to the simple broadsword I had found on a corpse a few moments earlier. So much for superior Japanese steel.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dark Souls III's areas are connected, but they are not interwoven like they were in the original Dark Souls. Instead, each area leads to the next in fairly linear fashion, so you progress through the stages like an old-school Castlevania game. There are many shortcuts and secrets to find within each area proper, but there is a distinct lack of unity within the world. I miss the tangled rats-nest feel that the original game had. Dark Souls III feels more like a dark fantasy theme park; each themed area railroads you into the next. The dragon-infested castle leads to the old shantytown, which leads to the forest, then the poisonous bog, etc. The transitions make sense, for the most part, but it would have been nice to find shortcuts that lead back to older zones.

		<H2 class="header">The Art of Warfare<H2>
		<p>
			Dark Souls III is an action game, which means that your skill comes into play far more often than your stats. The realm of Lothric is in a bad state, so dark beasts, insane undead, migrating dragons, and frightening demons have corrupted the majestic gothic cityscape. The improved combat mechanics add more depth to fighting, but also make it much more difficult to master, so cutting through a swathe of monsters is harder and more rewarding than it has ever been.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dark Souls III controls exactly the same as previous iterations in the series, so you should have no trouble acclimating yourself if you're familiar with the Souls games. Square uses consumable items, circle lets you evade, X is the interaction button, and triangle two-hands your weapon. R1 and R2 are your light and heavy attacks, respectively, while L1 and L2 are your shield skills.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dark Souls III adds new twists to staple skills. Your heavy attack can be charged by holding R2, like in 
			<a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> 
			, to deal more damage and weaken larger opponents. Weapon arts are also new to the series, and clearly inspired by 
			<a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> . Holding L2 when two-handing your weapon greatly expands your attack options, depending on the weapon. L2 lets you quick-dash when two-handing daggers, so you can dart in and out of range to deal damage. Two handing a broadsword gives you powerful guard-crushing strikes. Some weapons give you potent damage/defensive buffs instead of new offensive moves. I like the addition of battle arts, but overall I found myself relying on the series' classic abilities to get through the game. Launching a knight into the air with a greatsword uppercut is nice, but stabbing him in the back works just as well.
		</p>
		<p>
			Aside from the obvious 
			<a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>  
			influence, Dark Souls III includes many of the improvements from Dark Souls II. Rings give you potent perks, and you can equip four of them, like you could in Dark Souls II. You can cycle between three weapon/shields. Armor and weight mechanics work as they did Dark Souls II, so you can evade effectively so long as you wear less than 70% of your total equipment burden. The guard-break system is also straight from Dark Souls II, so breaking your opponent's guard lets you follow up with a powerful riposte. Finally, if you have a shield equipped, you can two-hand it by pressing and holding the triangle button.
		</p>
		<p>
			Major gameplay mechanics like parrying attacks and stabbing enemies in the back, work like they did in the original Dark Souls game. The combination of all of these elements results in one of the most complex Dark Souls games to date. These systems on their own are not difficult to utilize, but in application they create a much more challenging game overall.

			Dark Souls III is a visual tour de force. It weaves the fantasy setting of past Souls games with the grotesque and disturbing ambience of Bloodborne to push the atmosphere to all new levels. Every area in the game is filled with amazing visual details, complemented with truly haunting sound design. The cacophony of subtle footsteps, ragged breathing, weeping, howling, snarling, and crashing that follows you everywhere in Lothric makes the world feel alive, and very unwelcoming. I found myself looking over my shoulder constantly in Dark Souls III, because every step I took was followed by another that was not my own, or by the clamoring of some new threat sneaking up on me. It certainly doesn't help that many enemies patrol the environment now, so you can never truly know where monsters are hiding any more.
		</p>
		<p>
			This atmosphere comes at a cost, unfortunately. Dark Souls III runs at about 60 frames per second, generally, but dips to as low as 20 FPS depending on the environment. The most egregious performance drops occurred in the swamps within the Road of Sacrifices region, which incidentally is where I first noticed the issue. But performance issues cropped up regularly in later areas as well. Dropping the visuals from max to high didn't alleviate the matter, either.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dark Souls III auto-detects your PC specs and optimizes the visuals to suit your rig, by default. You can opt to customize each setting individually, which includes low, medium, high, and max values for texture, shadow, lighting, effect, water, shader, and depth of field. Antialiasing and SSAO can be turned on or off. Screen resolutions available on my monitor range from 800 by 600 to 1920by 1080, but Dark Souls III supports up to 4K resolution.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dark Souls III also suffers from a few technical hiccups aside from the performance ones. Keyboard and mouse controls feel clunky and inaccurate, regardless of how you adjust the mouse's sensitivity. I highly recommend playing Dark Souls III with a gamepad, as it was clearly designed with one in mind.
		</p>
		<p>
			Load times is another issue that dulls the experience a bit. Transitioning between areas is thankfully quick, so you can teleport from one region to the next in a matter of seconds. But I found that loading your save file when first booting the game can take anywhere from a few seconds to a full minute.
		</p>
		<p>
			Whenever you're invaded by another player, the game seals you within the area and essentially forces you to find one another and fight. But because online connectivity is a bit finicky, I would very often get sealed within an area despite not getting invaded at all. Homeward Bones, consumable items that return you to the last checkpoint, don't work effectively either. In past games you couldn't use this item during an invasion, so I suspect that the connectivity issue that seals me from time to time is the same one that prevents me from using Homeward Bones at random. I imagine that a patch might rectify these matters, but I found them to be irritating enough to be worth mentioning.

			Dark Souls III injects enough newness to the game formula to keep the experience fresh, while still adhering to the conventions that have defined the series. The new enemies, areas, and lore are enough to keep die-hard fans busy for a long time to come, while the expanded gameplay should satisfy fans that jumped on board with Bloodborne. The weak PC port is a touch disappointing, but considering previous PC releases, is par for the course. Dark Souls III is a fantastic action-RPG, and I highly recommend it.
