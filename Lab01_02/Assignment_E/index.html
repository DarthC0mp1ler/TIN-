				Lastly, we come to Secundinus. This is patently not his real name; he was called this because he offered no name and was the second man accused of the crimes in question.
			</p>
			<p>
				Secundinus was accused of nightly murders over the course of several months. His victims, days later, were often dug up and never seen again. No one knows what he did with the corpses. He was caught by Imperial City Imperial City guards, in the act of digging up a recent victim. He was chased down and killed. On his body were several objects of an unknown magical or ritualistic nature.

			<p>
				Legends swirled that Secundinus was not truly dead. Within days of his alleged death, several of the guards who killed him went missing. One was found dead, apparently strangled. Several eyewitnesses that night reported a cloaked figure dragging a body down into the sewers. Searches turned up nothing.

				Another of my cellmates dead. Typical. There are few mortals with the strength of body, of character, to survive here. But I will add young Vayron to the throne (when the masters have finished with his flesh), to serve me when my own body grows weary.
			</p>
			<p>
				Though I wish I could do what the masters can. They spend their nights returning the deceased to a semblance of animation, harvesting their skin to create living flesh weapons for the war raging above. Perhaps, one day, they will allow my flesh to serve.
			</p>
			<p>
				It's foolish of the generals and the Empress-Regent and whatever else remains of the Imperial hierarchy to continue the fight. They should accept Daedric rule; as I have. The Daedra waste nothing, and under them, everyone has a role. Even if that role is serving at the front of a war chariot. As an ornament.
